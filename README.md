# OpenhabSVG
Create a Dynamic SVG Representation
I got the idea from Word, where it is possible to add icons and later assign color attributes to them. I wanted to illustrate changes in temperature in my boiler and ultimately my entire house heating system. Currently, the repository includes three elements for you to use:

Item Definitions: Files for controlling the colors/items located at items/svg.items (currently not implemented).
Representation of the Image: In HTML, located at html/static/boiler.html (currently not implemented).
Script for Updating the Item: This is also currently not implemented.
Please note that I am by no means a professional in this field, but I am eager to learn! (-; This project might end up in the trash bin, but let's see what happens.
