# OpenhabSVG
Create an dynamic SVG representation
So i got the idea from word where it is possible to add Icons and give them color attributes afterwards.
I wanted to illustrate changes in temperature in my boiler and ultimative my entire house heating system.
Currently the repos include 3 elements for you to use:
1) the item definitions files for controlling the the colors /items/svg.items (currently not implemented)
2) the reprensation of to image "in html" /html/static/boiler.html (currently not implemented)
3) script for updating the item (currently not implemented)
please note i am by no means proffesionel at what i do but im eager to learn (-;
This project might end in the trashbin, lets see....
