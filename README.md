# OpenhabSVG
Create a Dynamic SVG Representation
I got the idea from Word, where it is possible to add icons and later assign color attributes to them. I wanted to illustrate changes in temperature in my boiler and ultimately my entire house heating system. Currently, the repository includes three elements for you to use:

1) Item Definitions
   Files for controlling the colors/items located at items/SVG.items.
3) Representation of the Image In HTML
   Located at html/static/boiler.html.
3) Script for Updating the Item:
   Located at automation/js/boilerSVG.js

Please note that I am by no means a professional in this field, but I am eager to learn! (-; This project might end up in the trash bin, but let's see what happens.

Try it out it is a lot of fun and has great potential
